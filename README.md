Yet another GMP C++ wrapper for High-Precision Calculations
# Overview

The gmpxx_mkII is a C++ class designed to facilitate high-precision arithmetic operations using the GMP library licensed under 2-clause BSD license. 
MPFR is a C library for multiple-precision floating-point computations with correct rounding. This class provides a convenient C++ wrapper around the MPFR library's functionalities.
Features
    
    * licensed under the 2-clause BSD License.
    * written from scratch
    * Easy-to-use interface for multiple-precision arithmetic.
    * Integration with MPFR library's multiple-precision types.
    * Exception safety and efficient memory management.
    * Support for copy and move semantics.
